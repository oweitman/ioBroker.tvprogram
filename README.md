## tvprogram adapter for ioBroker

This adapter polls information about the television program at regular intervals. 
The data can be displayed in various widgets. 

The adapter is still in an alpha phase in which widgets / functions are still being tested, 
functions / widgets can be added and removed or completely exchanged.

References to issues or feature requests can be left or 
discussed in the iobroker forum in the corresponding thread

## Developer manual
The adapter can currently only be installed via github. This can be done in the iobroker in the "adapter" tab, 
with the expert view via the github button (cat symbol).

Then enter the url of the github repository https://github.com/oweitman/iobroker.tvprogram in the "any" tab and install it.

### Adapter Configuration

No configuration currently required

### Widgets

#### Time
Currently only the widget "time" exists. This shows the current TV program on a timeline by TV channel.

To set it up, the adapter must have already accessed and filled the necessary data. 
In the configuration, the widget only needs to be filled with any data point of the adapter (e.g.config).
The widget searches for all remaining data points automatically.

If the text behind the channel logos shows through, a background color must be selected in the widget

Functions:

- show tv data on timeline by tv channel
- show details about a tv broadcast if available
- show a marker of actual position with automatic scrolling
- configure displayed tv channels and order, reordering ist possible via dragNdrop.
- switch command via datapoint after click on logo
- zoomin/zoomout
- navigation next and prev days
- play button to switchchannel datapoint
- center zoom in next days
- return to today
- reset zoom
